# the-big-shell
The assignment given is to make a UNIX shell and so I first started with the base of my shell.
To make the program loop in the main function, I used a while loop to infinitely loop it until
you type exit from the shell i also added a prompt to show the $ like how bash looks and even Korn, 
so I guess this could be present in most Unix/Unix-like shells. I made a character array that holds 
enough characters i think, and make my program read the input of the user, before using strcmp
to help with the exit, until then anything typed the shell will continue to run
